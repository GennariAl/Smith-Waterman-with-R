Description: This package provides a function to perform pairwise local alignment of nucletide sequences implementing the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The function reads 3 numerical parameters which defines the cost of a match, mismatch or the insertion of a gap between nucleotides of two sequences aligned. Then it perform the Smith-Waterman algorithm for Pairwise Local Alignment of sequences and return an list collecting the two aligned sub-sequences.
