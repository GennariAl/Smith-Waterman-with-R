# Smith-Waterman-with-R
I developed a R package implementing the Smith-Waterman algorithm for pairwise local alignment. The package building, check and installation works smoothly with 0 error (see log_file).  BiocCheck results show 1 error because Iâ€™m not registered at the support site, 1 warning because BiocViews terms are invalid. Check the log_file for more details.
